# API reference

This page is automatically created from the `docstrings` in the code. 
Mainly [topojson.core.topology]({{site.baseurl}}/api/topojson.core.topology.html) will be of interest for the user. 

**Note:** The page ['settings and tuning']({{site.baseurl}}/example/settings-tuning.html) explains all settings with detailed examples. 

All other classes and functions are used within the package. I could hide them, but maybe you find something interesting that can be used elsewhere.
