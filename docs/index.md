Topojson is a library that is capable of creating a topojson encoded format of merely any geographical data in Python.

With topojson it is possible to reduce the size of your geographical data, mostly by orders of magnitude. It is able to do so through:

- Eliminating redundancy through topology computation
- Fixed-precision integer encodig of coordinates and
- Simplification and quantization of coordinates
