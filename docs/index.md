<h2>Encode Geographic Data as Topology in Python!</h2>

Topojson is a library that is capable of creating a topojson encoded format of merely any geographical object in Python.

With topojson it is possible to reduce the size of your geographical data, mostly by orders of magnitude. It is able to do so through:

- Eliminating redundancy through computation of a topology
- Fixed-precision integer encoding of coordinates and
- Simplification and quantization of arcs
